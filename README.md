# ForestClearanceKMLs
Jupyter notebooks to bulk download KML files from the Forest clearance portal, Ministry of Environment and Forests, India (https://parivesh.nic.in/search_proposals.aspx).  

##### Steps
* Export the list of project as an XLS file from http://forestsclearance.nic.in/Online_Status.aspx. 
* Place the file in Jupyter's working directory. 
* Install the necessary Python libraries and run all the cells of the notebook. 


##### Why bulk download KML files?
Many projects listed on the Forest Clearance portal do not have adequate details. It is tedious to look for a particular project by name. Instead, if you know the location of 
a project, you can add download and add KML files in bulk to any GIS software and pin point the specific project.
